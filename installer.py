'''
This file should allow for easier updating as you can download .py files and adjust if needed and create executable locally instead of downloading.
Will just need to convert this file into an executable. Should be able to regularly update after downloading updated .py files from github.

    pass

# creates room file if not found. Will get data for room credit and what room types S/O & C/O equal that credit type
# Note for me: maybe use the excel sheet to grab data during script to be a universal. (might need to standardize suite values? Could cause the script to take a littl bit longer)
